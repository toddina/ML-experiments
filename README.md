# ML-experiments

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various machine learning algorithms applied to different datasets. The experiments are organized by problem type into three main categories:

- 📈 **Regression**
- 🧮 **Classification**
- 🔍 **Clustering**

Each notebook contains:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Data visualization
- Model training and evaluation
- Comments and explanations
